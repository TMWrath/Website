                            <strong>3D Modeling:</strong> I create detailed 3D models for various applications. 
                            For many of my designs, I provide <strong>print-ready files</strong> so you can bring them to life 
                            using your own 3D printer.

                            <strong>Songwriting:</strong> I write lyrics that capture emotions and tell stories. 
                            I also provide <strong>proof of concepts</strong> for my lyrics, demonstrating how they 
                            can be brought to life through music.
